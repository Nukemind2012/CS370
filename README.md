Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

When working on this project we were given (most) of the code. What we had to do was take our prior learning and implement an agent that could learn from its mistakes and solve a maze. I implemented a fairly simple one-
but in just 30 minutes it figured out how to win the game 100% of the time. I gave it a decay rate and more, put in alot of repeats so it would make a bunch of mistakes early and then learn from them, and with that I managed to be successful!


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists, well, deal with computers! Day in and day out they have to code.
But it is more than that, they also have to deal with emerging technologies and marry them to what is already going on.
More than that they ahve to innovate and grow.



How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach problems by searching for videos and textbooks- learning is the key to success. If I can learn not only will I solve the problem but not have it again in the future.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I am responsible for what I make- therefore I have ultimate liability. As an attorney too I have ethical obligations (covered under the MPRE) to serve my clients.
